# Detune

A low-quality stereo pitch shifter for the sort of chorus and detune effects found on multi-effects hardware.

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Detune | Detune amount in cents (left channel is lowered in pitch, right channel is raised) |
| Mix | Wet / dry mix |
| Output | Level trim |
| Latency | Trade-off between latency and low-frequency response |

This plug-in is a pitch shifter designed to produce the classic detune effect, where the left channel is shifted down in pitch and the right channel is shifted up.  This sounds similar to a chorus effect, but with less obvious modulation.  The delay inherent in the pitch shifting process can be adjusted with the Latency control â€” longer settings are needed to make low frequency signals sound smoother, but can also add a nice doubling effect to vocals.
