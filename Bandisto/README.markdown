# Bandisto

The original Multi-band distortion VST plug-in

This plug is like MultiBand but uses 3 bands of clipping instead of compression. This is unlikely to be a plug you use every day, but when you want to recreate the sound of torn bass-bins you know where to come!

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Listen | Audition the low, mid and high bands individually |
| L <> M | Low / mid crossover frequency |
| M <> H | Mid / high crossover frequency |
| L/M/H Dist | Distortion amount for each of the 3 bands |
| L/M/H Out | Output level trims |
| Mode | Set clipping to Bipolar (top and bottom of waveform) or Unipolar (just tops) |
